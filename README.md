# Machine Learning Assignment 3
By Maha Qaiser 22i-2348

This assignment involves building a machine learning pipeline for predicting housing prices using the **California Housing** dataset from `sklearn.datasets`. The project applies various regression techniques and training optimizations including:
- Batch, Stochastic, and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent  
- L1/L2 Regularization  
- Early Stopping  
- Model Deployment via Hugging Face  
- Inference script and web interface with Flask
